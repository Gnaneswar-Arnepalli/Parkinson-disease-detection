🧠 ** Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Machine Learning  **

Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects individuals over the age of 60. While there's no cure, early detection can significantly improve the quality of life by enabling timely interventions and therapies.​
Recognizing the importance of early diagnosis, I developed a machine learning model trained on a dataset of biomedical voice measurements. This model aims to identify early signs of Parkinson's disease, facilitating prompt treatment and management.


This is a machine learning-based web application to detect Parkinson’s Disease using various voice measurements. The application is built using:

🎯 Flask for backend

🌐 HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend

🧪 Scikit-learn and joblib for ML model training and loading

🚀 Features
1.Accepts user input through a form.
2.Loads a pre-trained model (parkinson_model.pkl).
3.Predicts if the person has Parkinson’s Disease or not.
4.Displays results dynamically on the frontend.

📌 Technologies Used
1.Python
2.Flask
3.Scikit-learn
4.HTML/CSS/JavaScript
